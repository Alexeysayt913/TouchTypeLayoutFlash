# TouchTypeLayoutFlash

TouchTypeLayoutFlash is a small helper tool for touch typists. It displays a large popup notification in the center of the screen whenever the keyboard layout changes (EN, RU, UA, etc.). This helps you stay aware of the active input language and avoid typing in the wrong layout.

## Why This Tool Exists

When touch typing, it is easy to miss the moment when the keyboard layout switches. TouchTypeLayoutFlash solves this problem by showing a clear, noticeable popup every time the input language changes.

- Popup size and position
- Colors and transparency
- Font
- Display duration

All settings are located directly in the script and are easy to edit.
